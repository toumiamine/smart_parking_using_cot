## Context
This project aims to prototype a system that makes it easy to find an empty parking
space and help customers save time and automate parking monitoring for park owners.
By realizing this project, we aim to:

• Concept and realize a full prototype of a smart parking system with the ability to
connect and control it remotely.

• Use different Inner and Outer network technologies: The use of different communication
techniques between the objects, main server, and the parking owner’s control
application.

• Use devices that saves power : The use of technologies that do not consume a lot
of resources is mandatory

• Security : Use different techniques and algorithms to guarantee the security and the
privacy of the data, sensors and mobile application.

• Scalability: The network needs to be scalable, which means that the possibility to
add new sensors and new smart things to the IoT network should be easy.
